	* cleanup management of per-event instruction set in pfmon_itanium.c
	  and pfmon_itanium2.c.

	* simplified management of entry number when sampling.

2002-11-21 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* added --smpl-print-counts option. By default counts are not
	  printed when sampling unless this option is specified.
	* added warning in compact sampling output mode  header when
	  randomization is not supported by kernel. We keep the same 
	  number of columns but the value is zero instead of the initial
	  value of first overflowed PMD.
	* added --trigger-start-delay option to both per-process and
	  system-wide modes.

	* fixed a sampling buffer bug in which the last set of samples
	  may be reported twice for non-blocking (default) per-process
	  sampling sessions. This is a kernel perfmon buf in 2.4.18 and
	  2.4.19. Need a way to identify each set of samples.

2002-09-25 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	  validate routines.

	  perfmon (CONFIG_PERFMON)

	  mode prints.
